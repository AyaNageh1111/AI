# AI

In this project, I implemented state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to train a reinforcement learning-based robot to navigate through unknown environments and successfully reach the end goal. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the robot is able to learn from its interactions with the environment, adapt its behavior, and make intelligent decisions to optimize its path to success. The project showcases the power and effectiveness of AI in enabling autonomous agents to explore and conquer unfamiliar terrains with precision and efficiency.
